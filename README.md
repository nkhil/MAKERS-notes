# Notes

This is a public list of things that has helped me understand concepts better, or gotten me out of a jam (for eg: `git stash`)

## Week 1

* Understanding explicit Vs implicit subject in RSpec

* Change the last commit message if you haven't pushed yet using `git commit --amend -m "new commit message"`

* **Git Stash**: If you run into conflicts at the time of pulling, and you want to 'stash' away your work (instead of dealing with conflicts), use `git stash`. Here's a quick explanation: 
> The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit. The modifications stashed away by this command can be listed with git stash list , inspected with git stash show , and restored (potentially on top of a different commit) with git stash apply.
